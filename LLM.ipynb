renewable-based technologies\\n[44]\\n.\\non these premises, this work aims at introducing a novel approach for the environmental analysis of communities and districts powered by a ready-to-use and user-friendly tool useful to promote and ease its implementation.\\nthe proposed methodology is based on a detailed mathematical model that proposes to accurately determine energy and environmental balances related to every kind of user aggregation (i.e., renewable energy communities, peds, etc.).\\ncompared to existing methods and supported by the proposed tool, it strives to move beyond a purely mathematical approach and also to verify the achievement of the goals of positive energy districts.\\nin addition, it aims at filling the research gaps emerging from the literature

industrial facilities and other activity sectors relevant to the energy demand of the district or community being analysed.\\nas shown in fig.\\n1\\n, the proposed approach focuses on thermal, cooling, and electric energy demand and supply during the operation phase of the district.\\nthe implementation of energy efficiency measures addressed to reduce the energy demand of the district under investigation, such as the energy renovation of buildings envelope, is left out of the proposed framework.\\nenergy and emission balances are determined on an annual basis, according to the definition of peds\\n[15]\\n.\\nin the case of existent districts, actual data referred to thermal, cooling, and electric energy demand collected from bills, surveys, smart meters, etc., can be used.\\nin the case of new districts, estimated data should be adopted.\\nsimilar considerations apply to the producibility of plants.\\nsince yearly balances are evaluated, annual data regarding energy demand and supply should be provided in input to the tool.\\naggregated data can be regarded as the sum of data available on a shorter timestep.\\nin this way, significant factors affecting the energy balance of the district (e.g., the simultaneity of energy demand and supply from renewable-based plants) may be considered for more accurately determining the share of energy self-consumption, surplus, and deficit production.\\nthe proposed methodology also allows to encompass the life-cycle perspective if life-cycle based emission factors are adopted.\\nthe methodology developed in this

buildings or groups of buildings and consider neither the impact on society at large nor the interaction with other energy consumers and producers.\\nmost zebs even neglect the fact that the mobility

used for the extraction, transportation and processing of primary fuels; energy losses in the thermal and electrical plant; and energy losses in transport and energy distribution to the building site.\\nbuilding energy refers to the on-site building energy consumption, including heating, cooling, ventilation, domestic hot water, indoor and outdoor use, lights, plug loads, process energy, elevators, conveying systems and intra-building transportation.\\nin addition to the zeb concept, the doe has defined three other concepts, the zero energy community (zeco), zero energy campus (zec) and zero energy portfolio (zep), which consider a cluster of buildings that operates as a unit that shares the same renewable energy systems\\n[6]\\n.\\nthese concepts are, however, not clearly defined, and the differences between the concepts are quite indistinct.\\nthe main advantage of the zeb, zeco, zec and zep concepts is that they strive to cover the aggregated demand of the buildings, and thus, the generated renewable energy is used where it is needed the most.\\nthe international energy agency (iea) has proposed a concept called autonomous zeb, which is an extension of the zeb\\n[15]\\n.\\nthese buildings are self-sustaining buildings with no connection to the grid and are able to produce enough on-site energy to satisfy their own energy demand.\\nin order to satisfy the energy demand day and night, summer and winter, energy must be stored.\\nthis differs from the net zeb concept, as the net zebs are able to interact with the external grid as long as the annual energy export is equal to the annual energy import.\\nthe iea does also bring up energy plus buildings (+zeb), which export more energy than they import\\n[15]\\n.\\ntable\\n1\\nshows a summary of the

(2010)\\n, wind power is, in general, more beneficial in europe from a load-matching perspective since both the wind power generation and the energy demand are higher during the winter than during the summer\\n[86]\\n.\\nsolar energy generation, on the other hand, is the highest during the summer months.\\nthus, from a load-matching point of view, a larger share of the ped energy generation mix should be covered by wind energy in most of europe.\\nthis is, however, not that simple, as installing wind turbines in populated areas is complicated and solar energy is, on a global level, a more cost-effective energy generation method\\n[32]\\n.\\nin most districts, especially in densely populated areas, space is also an issue.\\nrenewable energy systems must thus be integrated in a smart way, so that energy generation does not conflict with other functions that are essential for the district.\\nsolar power integration in urban districts is convenient since solar pvs, csps and solar heat collectors can be installed on rooftops and various available surfaces within districts.\\nsolar pv panels can also be integrated into building façades.\\nso-called building-integrated photovoltaics (bipv) can be integrated in stable and heavy structural elements as well as in lightweight and transparent structural elements\\n[90]\\n.\\naccording to a study by\\nfath et al. (2015)\\n, building façades provide almost three times the area of roofs in a 2 km 2 urban area in karlsruhe, germany\\n[91]\\n.\\nhowever, due to their angles and positions, they receive only 41% of the total solar irradiation.\\nhence, solar pv panels on roofs should be prioritized in peds, while façade solar pv panels can be considered if the solar radiation on a particular façade is sufficient.\\noverall, city-integrated solar pvs have a great potential and can satisfy over 60% of the electricity demand in some smaller cities in europe\\n[92,\\n93]\\n.\\nwind power integration in urban areas, on the other hand, does have many practicality issues and is thus less suitable for on-site energy generation in peds.\\nit would be complicated to install large-scale wind turbines due to their size, aesthetics and noise as well as low and turbulent urban wind-speed and safety issues\\n[94,\\n95]\\n.\\nsmall-scale wind turbines could be an option, but their cost per installed kwh is about twice as high as large-scale turbines\\n[32,\\n96]\\n.\\nvertical axis wind turbines (vawts) are a popular alternative among small-scale wind turbines.\\nthese wind turbines are able to handle the higher turbulence and varied wind speeds associated with urban environments\\n[94]\\n.\\nanother benefit with vawts is that the generator can be installed at a lower part of the so-called tower, allowing building-mounted turbines to be more easily serviced\\n[94]\\n.\\nthe hub height of small-scale urban wind turbines is, however, not high enough to access the same wind speeds as large-scale wind turbines\\n[97]\\n.\\ndue to the many shortcomings of wind turbine installations in urban areas, wind power is best suited for virtual power plants.\\nthe distance between the district and the virtual wind power farm could, however, be relatively short and thereby ease the power transmission to the district.\\nwind farms could, for instance, be installed in nearby rural areas or even offshore if the district is in a coastal area.\\nbioenergy and hydropower can be used to provide peds with flexible power when the intermittent energy generation is lower than the electricity demand\\n[98,\\n99]\\n.\\nthese flexible power generation methods make the district less dependent on electricity supplied by the external grid and thereby foster a positive annual energy balance.\\nbioenergy plants can be built almost anywhere in europe, as biomass is relatively cheap to transport from biomass-producing regions, such as the nordic countries, the baltic countries and austria\\n[50]\\n, to other parts of europe.\\nbioenergy generation does, however, produce emissions, which contradicts the ped's aim to provide a carbon-free energy environment and better life quality in residential areas.\\neven though bioenergy is carbon neutral from a life-cycle perspective (as the carbon dioxide emissions originate from carbon dioxide captured from the atmosphere by biomass), this does not change the fact that bioenergy plants pollute the air in the district where they operate.\\nhydropower, on the other hand, is extremely dependent on the location of the district since hydropower can only be generated in regions that satisfy the requirements described in section 4.1.3.\\nmost of the potential hydropower sites in europe are already in use or unattainable due to regulations and environmental protection\\n[100]\\n.\\nhence, hydropower is best suited for a virtual power plant for virtual peds, where the district boundaries are virtual instead of geographic.\\naccording to\\ngraabak et al.

pumps are expected to provide a significant share of future heating\\n[101]\\n.\\ndue to the flexibility and high coefficient of performance (cop) of modern heat pumps\\n[101]\\n, they could be a highly valued source for heating in future peds.\\ndue to the relatively large operating temperature interval, heat pumps can be used to recover low temperature heat from the ground and the ambient air as well as low temperature waste heat from sewage systems, ventilation air and other waste heat flows.\\nheat pumps are thus able to increase the total energy efficiency of peds and minimize the import of externally generated thermal energy.\\nmoreover, heat pumps provide additional flexibility to peds, as they can be used to transform electrical energy into heat that can be stored in

the ped.\\nthese ped definitions serve as the foundation of the ped concept in this paper.\\nan analysis was conducted to further investigate the available technologies and concepts that can be used for peds and networks of peds.\\nhere, it was found that not all available renewable energy and energy storage technologies are suitable for all types of peds.\\ndue to the high population density of modern european cities, some technologies are only possible to implement as vpps for virtual peds.\\nthese vpps are renewable energy generation and energy storage systems that are installed outside the geographical boundaries of the district.\\nexamples of technologies that are best suited as vpps are wind power and hydropower as well as large-scale energy storages, such as pumped hydro and caes.\\nsolar pv and batteries, on the other hand, are more suitable for an urban environment and are thus possible to install in all types of peds.\\nas a part of the analysis, the authors also proposed a unique onion model for constructing ped networks.\\naccording to this model, the majority of the peds are placed in the outskirts of the city, and the excess energy generated from these peds is exported to the more central areas in the city, where the renewable energy installations are not able to fulfil the energy demand.\\nthis way, it would be possible to increase the renewable energy share of the whole city.\\nin a regulation analysis, we found that there are several regulations and policies that benefit the implementation of peds throughout the eu.\\nthe european green deal and the clean energy package are examples of eu initiatives that are in line with the targets of the ped.\\nthe clean energy package has contributed to one of the most significant legislative advancements in favour of the ped concept, as the package recognizes the rights of communities and citizens to engage directly in the energy sector.\\nthe ped definition is still in a conceptualization phase, and further research is therefore needed in order to initiate a discussion on a societal level.\\nmore studies on the technological and economic viability of the ped are required, as well as comparative studies with other renewable energy solutions.\\na comparison between centralized large-scale renewable energy systems and ped-like distributed renewable energy systems would be a particularly interesting research topic.\\nanother topic that would need to be further investigated is the resilience of peds and how peds are able to handle various types of failures in the local energy system.', 'parent_section': None, 'processed_text': 'conclusion general survey renewable_energy market circumstance different part europe provide form conception potential

been applied and used in the building sector all over the world.\\nthe overall zeb definition states that \"the building can be considered as zeb after it shows through actual measurements that the energy delivered to the building is less than or equal to the onsite renewable exported energy\"\\n[1]\\n.\\nthese concepts are, however, only applicable on individual buildings or groups of buildings and consider neither the impact on society at large nor the interaction with other energy consumers and producers.\\nmost zebs even neglect the fact that the mobility sector is gradually connecting to the electricity grid.\\nnevertheless, zebs have recently received immense academic and political interest around the world\\n[2]\\n[3]\\n[4]\\n[5]\\n[6]\\n[7]\\n.\\nthe usa established the energy independence and security act of 2007\\n[8]\\nto support the building sector to create zero energy commercial buildings by the year 2030.\\nit also mentions converting 50% of american commercial buildings to zebs by 2040 and converting all commercial buildings into zebs by 2050\\n[9]\\n.\\nsimilar legislation and regulations have been adopted by the eu in the form of directive on energy performance of buildings (epbd), which aims to make all public buildings and new buildings nearly zero energy buildings by 2020\\n[7]\\n.\\nin europe, the european union (eu) has developed a framework that aims to reduce the emissions from buildings by improving the energy efficiency at the building level.\\nthe directive on energy performance of buildings (epbd) initiated in may 2010 states that a nearly zeb is a building with a high efficiency in terms of energy utilization and an energy demand that is mostly covered by on-site renewable energy generation\\n[7]\\n.\\nthe epbd also mentions that the nearly zeb definition can be flexible and adjusted to national or local requirements and targets.\\nnearly zeb impact factors, such as the energy efficiency of the buildings and renewable energy sources, are also defined on a national or a regional level.\\nmoreover, the primary energy factor is defined by the eu states based on national policies.\\ncost-optimal buildings are also introduced in the epbd in the delegated regulation no 244/2012\\n[10]\\n.\\nthe cost-optimality is defined as the optimal ratio between the life cycle costs and the energy efficiency of the building\\n[11]\\n.\\nthis ratio varies from one eu region to another because the climate and the building standards are different in different eu regions\\n[12]\\n[13]\\n[14]\\n.\\naccording to the us department of energy (doe), a zeb is an \"energy efficient building where, on a source energy basis, the actual annual delivered energy is less than or equal to the on-site renewable exported energy\"\\n[6]\\n.\\nhere, the source energy means the total life cycle energy of the building, including the building energy; the energy used for the extraction, transportation and processing of primary fuels; energy losses in the thermal and electrical plant; and energy losses in transport and energy distribution to the building site.\\nbuilding energy refers to the on-site building energy consumption, including heating, cooling, ventilation, domestic hot water, indoor and outdoor use, lights, plug loads, process energy, elevators, conveying systems and intra-building transportation.\\nin addition to the zeb concept, the doe has defined three other concepts, the zero energy community (zeco), zero energy campus (zec) and zero energy portfolio (zep), which consider a cluster of buildings that operates as a unit that shares the same renewable energy systems\\n[6]\\n.\\nthese concepts are, however, not clearly defined, and the differences between the concepts are quite indistinct.\\nthe main advantage of the zeb, zeco, zec and zep concepts is that they strive to cover the aggregated demand of the buildings, and thus, the generated renewable energy is used where it is needed the most.\\nthe international energy agency (iea) has proposed a concept called autonomous zeb, which is an extension of the zeb\\n[15]\\n.\\nthese buildings are self-sustaining buildings with no connection to the grid and are able to produce enough on-site energy to satisfy their own energy demand.\\nin order to satisfy the energy demand day and night, summer and winter, energy must be stored.\\nthis differs from the net zeb concept, as the net zebs are able to interact with the external grid as long as the annual energy export is equal to the annual energy import.\\nthe iea does also bring up energy plus buildings (+zeb), which export more energy than they import\\n[15]\\n.\\ntable\\n1\\nshows a summary of the zero energy and positive energy definitions

that is highly dependent on the geographical location.\\nin northern europe, where there are only a few hours of daylight in the winter season, solar pv generation is significantly lower than in southern europe.\\nhence, the capital costs per kwh of generated solar power are significantly higher in the nordic countries compared to the mediterranean region.\\nthe situation is similar for wind

technologies also have different properties when it comes to flexibility, cost and service life\\n[32]\\n.\\nintermittent renewable energy generation technologies, such as solar and wind energy, are considered non-flexible energy sources, as they can only generate energy when the wind speed and solar radiation are sufficient.\\nrun-of-river hydropower is more flexible than solar and wind energy, but not as flexible as reservoir hydropower and bioenergy.\\nthe installation costs, costs of electricity and service lives of different renewable energy technologies are presented in table\\na1\\nin

energy export price is often lower than the energy import price for small-scale energy producers\\n[88]\\n, it might be beneficial for a ped to minimize the external grid interaction.\\nby diversifying the intermittent renewable energy generation, it would be possible to achieve a positive annual energy balance with a lower export rate\\n[89]\\n.\\naccording to a study by\\nheide et al. (2010)\\n, wind power is, in general, more beneficial in europe from a load-matching perspective since both the wind power generation and the energy demand are higher during the winter than during the summer\\n[86]\\n.\\nsolar energy generation, on the other hand, is the highest during the summer months.\\nthus, from a load-matching point of view, a larger share of the ped energy generation mix should be covered by wind energy in most of europe.\\nthis is, however, not that simple, as installing wind turbines in populated areas is complicated and solar energy is, on a global level, a more cost-effective energy generation method\\n[32]\\n.\\nin most districts, especially in densely populated areas, space is also an issue.\\nrenewable energy systems must thus be integrated in a smart way, so that energy generation does not conflict with other functions that are essential for the district.\\nsolar power integration in urban districts is convenient since solar pvs, csps and solar heat collectors can be installed on rooftops and various available surfaces within districts.\\nsolar pv panels can also be integrated into building façades.\\nso-called building-integrated photovoltaics (bipv) can be integrated in stable and heavy structural elements as well as in lightweight and transparent structural elements\\n[90]\\n.\\naccording to a study by\\nfath et al. (2015)\\n, building façades provide almost three times the area of roofs in a 2 km 2 urban area in karlsruhe, germany\\n[91]\\n.\\nhowever, due to their angles and positions, they receive only 41% of the total solar irradiation.\\nhence, solar pv panels on roofs should be prioritized in peds, while façade solar pv panels can be considered if the solar radiation on a particular façade is sufficient.\\noverall, city-integrated solar pvs have a great potential and can satisfy over 60% of the electricity demand in some smaller cities in europe\\n[92,\\n93]\\n.\\nwind power integration in urban areas, on the other hand, does have many practicality issues and is thus less suitable for on-site energy generation in peds.\\nit would be complicated to install large-scale wind turbines due to their size, aesthetics and noise as well as low and turbulent urban wind-speed and safety issues\\n[94,\\n95]\\n.\\nsmall-scale wind turbines could be an option, but their cost per installed kwh is about twice as high as large-scale turbines\\n[32,\\n96]\\n.\\nvertical axis wind turbines (vawts) are a popular alternative among small-scale wind turbines.\\nthese wind turbines are able to handle the higher turbulence and varied wind speeds associated with urban environments\\n[94]\\n.\\nanother benefit with vawts is that the generator can be installed at a lower part of the so-called tower, allowing building-mounted turbines to be more easily serviced\\n[94]\\n.\\nthe hub height of small-scale urban wind turbines is, however, not high enough to access the same wind speeds as large-scale wind turbines\\n[97]\\n.\\ndue to the many shortcomings of wind turbine installations in urban areas, wind power is best suited for virtual power plants.\\nthe distance between the district and the virtual wind power farm could, however, be relatively short and thereby ease the power transmission to the district.\\nwind farms could, for instance, be installed in nearby rural areas or even offshore if the district is in a coastal area.\\nbioenergy and hydropower can be used to provide peds with flexible power when the intermittent energy generation is lower than the electricity demand\\n[98,\\n99]\\n.\\nthese flexible power generation methods make the district less dependent on electricity supplied by the external grid and thereby foster a positive annual energy balance.\\nbioenergy plants can be built almost anywhere in europe, as biomass is relatively cheap to transport from biomass-producing regions, such as the nordic countries, the baltic countries and austria\\n[50]\\n, to other parts of europe.\\nbioenergy generation does, however, produce emissions, which contradicts the ped's aim to provide a carbon-free energy environment and better life quality in residential areas.\\neven though bioenergy is carbon neutral from a life-cycle perspective (as the carbon dioxide emissions originate from carbon dioxide captured from the atmosphere by biomass), this does not change the fact that bioenergy plants pollute the air in the district where they operate.\\nhydropower, on the other hand, is extremely dependent on the location of the district since hydropower can only be generated in regions that satisfy the requirements described in section 4.1.3.\\nmost of the potential hydropower sites in europe are already in use or unattainable due to regulations and environmental protection\\n[100]\\n.\\nhence, hydropower is best suited for a virtual power plant for virtual peds, where the district boundaries are virtual instead of geographic.\\naccording to\\ngraabak et al.

highly valued source for heating in future peds.\\ndue to the relatively large operating temperature interval, heat pumps can be used to recover low temperature heat from the ground and the ambient

for peds and networks of peds.\\nhere, it was found that not all available renewable energy and energy storage technologies are suitable for all types of peds.\\ndue to the high population density of

proposed a unique onion model for constructing ped networks.\\naccording to this model, the majority of the peds are placed in the outskirts of the city, and the excess energy generated from these peds is exported to the more central areas in the city, where the renewable energy installations are not able to fulfil the energy demand.\\nthis way, it would be possible to increase the renewable

import/export conditions.\\nthey also pointed out that ped is highly dependent on local context with many impacting factors, such as the available renewable energy sources, energy storage potential, population, energy consumption behavior, costs and regulations, which affect the design and operation of peds in different regions.\\na series of technical solutions, such as the integration of batteries, electric vehicles (ev), and grid-responsive control, were discussed to promote the development of peds\\n[5]\\n.\\nsamadzadegan et al.\\n[6]\\ndeveloped a framework to design energy systems for ped or zero-carbon districts, by focusing on estimating heating and cooling demand and sizing related renewable energy systems, e.g., solar photovoltaic (pv) and heat pumps.\\nshnapp et al.\\n[7]\\nproposed handling the energy performance targets by transferring to the district level the minimum energy requirements imposed by the energy performance of buildings directives to individual buildings.\\ngabaldón moreno et al.\\n[8]\\nproposed a methodology for calculating the energy balance at the district level and energy performance of those districts with the potentials to become peds.\\na \"double density\" simulation scenario was studied further by bambara et al.\\n[9]\\nto test residential densification potential for ped, where each existing detached house in a community is replaced with two energy-efficient houses of equal living area on the same land lot.\\nfrom economical and technical points of view, laitinen et al.\\n[10]\\nconcluded that it is more feasible to achieve ped or net-zero energy district, rather than full energy self-sufficiency after they studied a series of technologies (e.g., local centralized wind power, solar pv, battery, heat storage and heat pump), using helsinki as a case study.\\nmoreover, soutullo et al.\\n[11]\\nsuggested that urban living labs could be a driver to achieve ped.\\nfatima et al.\\n[12]\\nstudied ped\\'s implementation potential from a citizen engagement aspect.\\nuspenskaia et al.\\n[13]\\nrecommended planning and modeling the replication of ped at the very early stage because it is important to find tailor-made solutions to fit spatial, legislative, socio-economic conditions and historical growth of the cities.\\napart from the newly built districts, an explanatory study was carried out as the first step to support the complex planning urban refurbishment, in order to achieve ped\\n[14]\\n.\\nin their study, the key information on the different district types (e.g., energy consumption) was simulated to identify the districts with the highest potential for energy refurbishment.\\nciviero et al.\\n[15]\\nprovide a view of a district simulation model able to analyze a reliable prediction of potential business scenarios on large scale retrofitting actions and to evaluate a set of parameters and co-benefits resulting from the renovation process of a cluster of buildings.\\ngouveia et al.\\n[16]\\nalso argued that the transformation of the existing districts is essential, including historic districts, which present common challenges across eu cities, such as degraded dwellings, low-income families, and gentrification processes due to massive tourism flows.\\nin their report, they discussed how the ped model can be an opportunity for historic districts to reduce their emissions and mitigate energy poverty.\\nmoreover, a methodology for the evaluation of positive energy buildings and neighbourhoods is proposed in the report\\n[17]\\n, where a set of key performance indicators (kpis) are defined with details on the calculation procedure for categories of energy and environmental, economic, indoor environmental quality (ieq), social, smartness and energy flexibility.\\na research gap is thus observed that there are many studies starting to address technical, economic, social aspects of ped, but very limited studies are found in characterizing ped.\\nthe joint programme initiative urban europe (jpi ue)\\n[18]\\nplays an important role in coordinating ped projects across europe, it actively engages the interests of different stakeholders, particularly, cities in peds.\\nto accomplish its objectives, only bossi et al.\\n[19]\\nsummarized part of ped\\'s characteristics in aspects of geographic distribution, implementation status, building structure, land use, energy typology, success factors/challenges, and barriers.\\nwhile brozovsky et al.\\n[20]\\nidentified different terminologies of ped, and related focused aspects (i.e., energy, social, climate).\\njpi ue needs more comprehensive scientific advice on the knowledge and methods for guiding the design, monitoring the operation and evaluating the performance of ped projects.\\ntherefore, many other ped characteristics need to be abstracted and categorized for further development of ped, such as district size, finance source, energy concepts, building archetypes, spatial/temporal scale and keywords.\\nmoreover, as ped projects are expanding all the time, it is necessary to use a common tool/database to increase the semantic interoperability among different stakeholders, for an updated summary of ped\\'s main characteristics.\\nin the framework of both international energy agency-energy in buildings and communities (iea ebc) programme annex 83\\n[21]\\nand eu cost action ca19126\\n[22]\\n, the working groups are now collecting data of peds and characterizing them for potential proposal of reference and replication of peds in different contexts.\\nthis paper, therefore, reviews the existing 60 projects within the european area from the jpi urban europe ped booklet, establishes the database, and further analyze/visualizes them for the main characteristics.\\nthe paper aims to illustrate the basic characteristics of existing ped projects in the eu, and then deliver the information to the targeted stakeholders, such as municipality, urban planner, real estate developer, utility company, policy/regulation maker, renewable energy provider, energy engineer etc., for them to further define, design, promote and implement potential ped projects.\\nas the ped concept is new to most of the stakeholders, this paper intends to transfer the knowledge to the targeted groups through the review/analysis and the development of

diversity.\\naccording to results, the identified 60 projects are constituted in europe with a large number of projects in norway (9 projects) and italy (8 projects) respectively.\\nalthough the first project took place in 1970, the momentum for such climate neutral goals has started in 2014.\\naccording to the database, most ped related projects choose 'yearly' as the time scale.\\nhowever, it is not possible to identify the temporal scale for many projects since they are still under the planning stage.\\nregarding the project area (spatial scale), the general trend is to include residential, commercial and industrial buildings for installation of renewable energy systems in a city or district, which is to avoid the deployment of large energy systems in open fields.\\nthis might need supporting policies that support direct consumers to involve in adapting implementation on their premises.\\nhowever, this strategy would need to consider providing economic feasibility or encouraging policies that attract private investments.\\nthe analysis observes that public, private with regional/national grants is a commonly used financial model which reflects active involvement from the private sector.\\nin addition, there are some projects that do not have many local renewable energy sources, but they purchase energy from outside of the district boundary (so-called 'virtual ped').\\nbased on the results, residential, commercial and office/social buildings are highly involved in the installation of energy systems, which depends on citizens commitment towards project goals (but the goals might deviate from the designed timeframe of the project).\\nmeanwhile, the stakeholders, such as the municipality, would need to address overcoming the policy restrictions to further ease the process of adapting the energy system, and also need to conduct necessary activities to bring awareness in consumers and motivate for participation.\\nthe energy mix for project goals includes solar energy, district heating/cooling, wind and geothermal energy are primary technologies, where solar technologies show dominance because of its potential.\\nhowever, due to the unavailability of solar energy during most half of the day and during winter seasons, exploration towards other forms of renewable energy sources, such as geothermal energy, wind, etc., yet may not be totally reliably options during peak demands.\\nin this context, energy storage might be the alternative way.\\napparently, energy storage has not been part of the major energy strategies, which might be due to the unavailability of enough planning, economic feasibility, high maintenance etc.\\nthis also might be part of the reason for ped related projects choosing a yearly temporal scale rather than daily/monthly or seasonally.\\nin terms of the most used words in the project descriptions, it is observed that projects that are already 'implemented' (both ped and towards ped) tend to concentrate highly on 'consumption', 'production', 'heating'-characteristics that are generally repeatedly showed interest in when the project is implemented and running.\\non the other hand, projects that are yet 'planning' (both ped and towards ped) tend to concentrate on 'solutions', 'research'-characteristics that are generally repeatedly discussed when a project is being planned.\\nprojects that are in the middle, i.e., 'in implementation' (both ped and towards ped) mostly repeat words like 'planning' and 'solution', like the 'planning' stage projects, but given they are closer to 'implementation' they also display interest in 'heating' and 'supply'.\\nin the sentiment analysis plot, we deduce that while the x-axis does not reflect a particular pattern, it is observed that projects that are still in the planning phase are more akin to depend on established facts for their documentation, whereas the implemented projects lean towards expressing more opinions (that hint their documentation is developed through experience) and do not have to depend solely on facts.\\nthe lessons learned from the preliminary analysis of these ped projects provide a starting point for achieving the objective of reducing the existing research gap in the characterization of peds.\\na key aspect is facing the complexity of the urban system and the resulting interrelationships between social inclusion, energy systems, infrastructure, circular economy and mobility for sustainable urbanization.\\nthis calls up building or ped-related simulation tools or platforms to tackle such challenges\\n[52,\\n53]\\n.\\nmoreover, a short summary of a few ped projects with a good level of detailed data has been further analyzed in terms of their energy balance/flows.\\ntable\\n4 provides\\n• the demand for heat on the campus is covered by on-site heat production through the chp plant.\\n• one-third of the electricity demand is covered.\\n• the rest is supplied by solar pv with batteries.\\n• existing district heating used by biomass will be replaced by large scale biofuel chp plant along with geothermal energy unit, waste heat combustion and district cooling heat pumps etc. • primarily trying to reduce the energy needs yearly by improving energy efficiency.\\n• installing solar power on rooftop of buildings for more sustainability.\\nreprinted from\\n[55]\\n.\\nit is observed the major energy contributions varies from district to district.\\nfor instance, åland island replies on biomass and wind power a lot, while stor-elvdal municipality prefers chp plant, and in drammen municipalities, a heat pump is used mostly.\\nhowever, these districts are not fully self-sufficient, and they have to import energy to cover peaks.\\nfor instance, as shown in figure\\n12\\n, åland island has to import 4 or 7 gwh of electricity in 2030.\\nit is not easy to judge whether they are peds or not at this stage since there is no standard and kpis available now.\\naccording to the mentioned work from eera jpsc and jpi ue, four categories of peds have been established based on two main aspects: the boundaries and limits of the ped in order to reach a net positive yearly energy balance and the energy exchanges (import/export) in order to compensate for energy surpluses and shortages between the buildings or the external grid.\\nall the four described categories of peds (ped autonomous, ped dynamic, and ped virtual, candidate-ped) are based on the accomplishment of a yearly positive energy balance, measured in greenhouse gas emissions, with use of renewables within the defined boundaries, and considering both building energy use and non-building energy use in a neighbourhood.\\nauto-and dynamic-peds are the only categories where a net positive energy balance is achieved and candidate-ped should compensate the energy difference with imported certified energy from outside the boundary.\\naccording to the boundaries descriptions aligned to the draft definition of peds from eera jpsc working group and jpi urban europe, the net positive yearly energy balance is assessed within the functional or virtual boundaries.\\nthus, peds will achieve a net positive energy balance and dynamic exchanges within the functional/virtual boundaries, but in addition, it may provide a connection between buildings within the virtual boundaries of the neighbourhood.\\nit is necessary to pay specific attention to the differences between cities across different regions when promoting the development of peds.\\nthis is because cities differ from each other at the local, national and international levels from the perspectives of geography, resources, social, economy, culture, infrastructure, and progress for the carbon-neutral target.\\nthis would bring a difference in planning, technology selection/implementation, investment portfolio, stakeholders involvement, regulations, keywords etc., during the ped development.\\nhowever, it is important to have a commonly recognized definition of ped, and its related kpi framework for evaluation.\\nby learning the main characteristics from those existing ped projects in the eu, it is helpful to define ped or propose 'reference ped' in other cultural and geographical contexts, which will bring significant common values in terms of replicability and potential generalization of ped across the globe.\", 'parent_section': None, 'processed_text': \"discussion study project take pe book jpi urban europe invite voluntary input datum project experience knowledge note overview ped europe country
